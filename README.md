**Project Title: Big Data Analysis Using PySpark on Smart LMS Dataset**

This project focuses on performing large-scale educational data analysis using Apache PySpark on a Smart Learning Management System (LMS) dataset. The primary objective was to demonstrate how big data technologies can efficiently process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large volumes of student academic and engagement records. All major operations such as data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, aggregation, and statistical computation were carried out using PySpark’s distributed processing framework. Only small, aggregated datasets were converted into Pandas format for visualization purposes, ensuring scalability and performance were maintained throughout the analysis.

One of the key achievements of this project is the demonstration of scalable processing efficiency. The Smart LMS dataset contained a large number of student records with multiple learning attributes such as attendance rate, quiz scores, time spent on the platform, engagement levels, and final grades. PySpark successfully handled this large-scale dataset through parallel processing and in-memory computation, proving its suitability for big data applications in the educational domain.

The final grade distribution was visualized using a pie chart, which revealed a balanced spread of students across different grade categories. This indicates a diverse range of academic performance levels within the dataset and highlights the importance of personalized academic monitoring. Further analysis examined the relationship between attendance and academic performance. Bar graphs and box plots clearly showed that students with higher attendance rates consistently achieved better final grades and exam scores. This confirms attendance as a strong and reliable indicator of student success.

The exam performance trend across grades was analyzed using a line graph. The results showed a steady increase in average final exam scores as the final grade category improved, establishing a direct and positive relationship between grading levels and academic achievement. This trend validates the grading system and reflects consistent evaluation standards within the LMS.

Student engagement was another critical focus of the analysis. Histogram visualizations indicated that most students spent a moderate to high amount of time on the learning platform. Scatter plots further revealed a positive correlation between time spent and final exam scores, confirming that higher engagement levels significantly enhance academic performance. These findings emphasize the role of digital learning activity in improving student outcomes.

Outlier detection was performed using box plots to identify extreme values in attendance rates, exam scores, and engagement metrics. After capping and treating these outliers, the performance indicators became more stable and reliable, improving the overall quality of the analysis. A correlation heatmap was then used to examine relationships between learning features. Strong positive correlations were observed between attendance rate and final exam score, time spent and quiz performance, and overall engagement and final grades. These relationships highlight the combined impact of regular participation and continuous assessment on student success.

Finally, PySpark ranking and sorting techniques were used to identify top-performing and highly engaged students based on activity levels and time spent. This approach enables early detection of both high achievers and at-risk learners, supporting timely academic intervention.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the power of PySpark in scalable big data processing for smart education systems. By combining distributed computation with insightful visualizations, the analysis provides valuable evidence that attendance, engagement, and continuous assessment play a crucial role in academic performance. The results confirm that big data analytics can effectively support academic monitoring, performance prediction, and informed decision-making in modern learning management systems.
